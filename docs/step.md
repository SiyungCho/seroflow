# Step Documentation

The modules documented here define the base structure and a concrete implementation for Pypeline steps. They provide a common interface to initialize, clean up, and execute operations (steps) within an ETL pypeline.

## Overview

This documentation covers two modules:

- **abstract_step**:  
  Defines the `AbstractStep` abstract class, which specifies the interface for creating steps. Subclasses must implement the abstract methods:
  - `start_step()`
  - `stop_step()`
  - `execute()`

- **step**:  
  Implements the `Step` class, a concrete subclass of `AbstractStep` that encapsulates a single operation or transformation. The `Step` class manages function initialization, parameter handling, default values, error handling, and dynamic updates to return and parameter lists. It can be used to create a custom `Step` via, subclass creation, the transformation subclass or wrapper definition.

## Class: AbstractStep

`AbstractStep` is an abstract base class that defines the structure of a Pypeline step. It extends Pythonâ€™s `ABC` (Abstract Base Class) and enforces the implementation of the following methods:

- **`start_step()`**  
  *Abstract Method*  
  Should contain logic to initialize the step before execution.

- **`stop_step()`**  
  *Abstract Method*  
  Should contain logic to clean up the step after execution is complete.

- **`execute()`**  
  *Abstract Method*  
  Should contain the main functionality of the step.

**AbstractStep Example:**

```python
from abstract_step import AbstractStep

class MyStep(AbstractStep):
    def start_step(self):
        # Initialize resources or validate input
        pass

    def stop_step(self):
        # Perform cleanup after execution
        pass

    def execute(self):
        # Implement the step's main logic
        return "Step executed"
```

Although the AbstractStep class can be used to create Custom Step Objects, it is not recommended due to the fact that the user will need to implement the logic for interaction between the Custom Step and the Pypeline Object. It is instead recommended to use the `Step` Class documented below.

## Class: Step

The `Step` class is a concrete implementation of `AbstractStep` that encapsulates the logic for executing a function with given parameters and DataFrames. It also serves as a convenient wrapper, allowing you to easily create custom steps by simply decorating your function with `@Step()`. It is highly recommended that any custom step operations users may want to develop are subclasses of the Step Class if the user wishes to implement a pre and post execution logic. In other general cases, the wrapper technique is recommended. However unlike the AbstractStep this is not obligatory.

Variables created inside a Step Function can be returned and will subsequently be saved as a variable internally within the Pypeline Object.
Subsequent steps that request a variable will be passed the value most recently stored. This way interstep variable communication can be performed. Other methods such as caching can also aid with this.
  
## Initialization

Arguments:
            step_name (str): 
                The name of the step
            params (dict): 
                The parameters to be passed to the function
            dataframes (List): 
                The DataFrames to be used in the step
            on_error (str): 
                The error handling strategy
            **kwargs: 
                Additional keyword arguments for the function


- **`__init__(self, step_name=None, params=None, dataframes=None, on_error='raise', **kwargs)`**  
  Initializes a new `Step` instance.
  
  **Parameters:**
  
  - `step_name` *(str)*: 
    - A string defining the name of the Step.
  - `params` *(Dict)*: 
    - A Dictionary mapping the variable name and its parameter value.
    - **These parameters will take priority over any current value stored by the `Pypeline` Object on execution.**
  - `dataframes` *(List[str])*: 
    - A list containing the names of DataFrames needed.
  - `on_error` *("raises", "ignore")*: 
    - `"raises"`: Raises Exceptions terminating `Pypeline` execution.
    - `"ignore"`: Ignores Exceptions terminating the `Step` without terminating the `Pypeline` execution.
  - `**kwargs` *(Any)*: 
    - Any key word arguments needed to be passed. 
    - When creating a custom `Step` via inheritance of the `Step` class, the `func` key word argument is used to initialize the step function.

#### Initialization Example

Below is a simple example that shows how to initialize a `Pypeline` object:

```python
  from pypeline import Pypeline
  from pypeline.cache import LFUCache

  # Initialize a pypeline with caching and logging enabled in development mode.
  pypeline = Pypeline(cache=LFUCache, logger=True, mode="DEV")
```

## Creating Custom Steps via the Step Class
There are 3 main ways to create custom `Step` Objects to use within the `Pypeline` execution. For most basic and quick step creation the wrapper method is recommended. For more complex transformations and operations, inheriting the `Step` or `Transformation` Class is recommended.

### Option 1: Wrapper Method
The wrapper method is the simplest way to create a custom `Step` object. It allows the user to insert the `Step` using the `add_step(s)(...)` methods. The wrapper method also allows users to call the step function as if it were a regular python function by creating the needed variables and passing them into the function to test its execution.

To create a custom `Step` using the wrapper method, users simply add the `@Step()` wrapper above a function. This turns the function into a `Step` function and allows it to be passed into the `Pypeline` object. 
- A `'step_name'` argument can be passed as a parameter in the `@Step(step_name="...")` wrapper to give the step a specific name, however, this is optional and if omitted the function's name is the default name used. 
- A `'dataframes'` argument can be passed as a parameter in the `@Step(dataframes=[...])` wrapper to specify which DataFrames are to be passed into the step during `Pypeline` execution. **If omitted then all DataFrames are loaded into the step.**
- A `'params'` argument can be passed as a parameter in the `@Step(params={"...": ...})` wrapper to pass values to variables used in the function. In `Pypeline` execution, these values passed via the `'params'` parameter take precedence over any current value stored internally within the `Pypeline` Object. 
- Default values within the functions signature can also be used however, these have the lowest level of precedence.
- In `Pypeline` execution the priority hierarchy for a variables value goes as such:
  
  1. Values stored via a `Step`'s params parameter.
  2. Values stored internally within the `Pypeline` Object
  3. Default values defined by the function's signature

#### Example

Below is a simple example that shows how to create a custom `Step` using the wrapper method:

```python
  from pypeline import Pypeline
  from pypeline.step import Step # Import the Step class
  
  @Step(dataframes=['df1', ...], params={'a':10, ...}) # Create a Custom Step using the wrapper format
  def sample_function(context, a, b=1):
    df1 = context.get_dataframe('df1')
    print(a)
    return context, b

  pypeline = Pypeline()
  pypeline.add_step(sample_function) # We can add the Custom Step function by passing the function name as an object

  sample_function(...) # Wrapper based function can also be called as a normal python function
```


### Option 2: Inherit the Step Class
The wrapper method is a slightly more involved way to create a custom `Step` object. It allows the user to insert the `Step` using the `add_step(s)(...)` methods. However, unlike the wrapper method does not intuitively allow users to call the step function as if it were a regular python function. 

Inheriting the `Step` Class does however, allow users to define a more complex methodology for how the custom step is to be executed. Namely the methods: `start_step(...)` and `stop_step(...) ` allow users to define logic which occurs directly before and after the execution of the step function. This allows for pre and post validation, type checking and more.

Parameter definition is the same as the wrapper method, however, a `'step_name'` must be defined as the name `'func'` will cause errors in `Pypeline` execution.

#### Example

Below is a simple example that shows how to create a custom `Step` by inheriting the `Step` class:

```python
  from pypeline import Pypeline
  from pypeline.step import Step # Import the Step class
  
  class CustomStep(Step):
    def __init__(self, dataframes, params, step_name="sample_function", on_error="raise", ...):
      super().__init__(step_name=step_name, dataframes=dataframes, params=params, func=self.func, on_error=on_error)
    
    def func(context, a, b=1):
      df1 = context.get_dataframe('df1')
      print(a)
      return context, b

    def start_step(...):
      ...

    def stop_step(...):
      ...

  custom_step = CustomStep(...)

  pypeline = Pypeline()
  pypeline.add_step(custom_step) # We can add the Custom Step function by passing the object
```

### Option 3: Inherit the Transformation Class
