Welcome to **Seroflow**! This repository contains the source code, documentation, and examples to help you get started and contribute to this project.

## Overview
`Seroflow` is a powerful Python package designed to help users build and execute efficient data pipelines. Developing ETL, ELT and other forms of data pipelines has never been easier with `Seroflow's` emphasis on performance, customization and ease-of-use.

With `Seroflow`, each phase of your data pipeline is broken down into concrete steps: `Extractor` steps for data extraction, `Transformation` steps for data manipulation, and `Loader` steps for data loading. Think of it like assembling a Lego setâ€”Seroflow provides all the essential bricks, and you simply pick and add the desired step objects sequentially into a `Pipeline` object, then run `pipeline.execute()` to run your entire process. 

Additionally, the package supports seamless creation of custom `Extractors`, `Loaders`, and `Transformations` through its intuitive interfaces, along with robust features like logging, caching, and chunking. Plus, it comes preloaded with over 70+ predefined transformations, making it an indispensable tool for data pipeline creation and execution.
