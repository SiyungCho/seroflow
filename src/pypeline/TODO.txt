TODO:

post v4 TODO:
- fix adl e/l
- fix sql e/l
- finish linting
- rename recursive chunker to something else, like distributed chunker
- when chunk_size is specified without chunker then normal single chunk execution is used (ie basic pandas chunking)
- when chunk_size is used with chunker then chunk_func() is used. we can then probably get rid of chunk_func and instead pass the proper chunking parameters in the chunker side instead of calculating it on the extractor side.

- documentation
- pytests
- upload to pip

future
- add universal engine
- add MT and MP
- add REST compatible e/l
- use other container types (numpy, spark dataframes)
- optimized data viz
- conditional steps (ie skip step, perform step)
- intermediate chunking checkpoints
- looped steps
