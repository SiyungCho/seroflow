TODO:

v3
- fix adl e/l
- test recursive chunking logic
- cache has 'on_finish' property

v4
- fix logger and turn logger off and on
- fix display steps
- implement different 'modes' for pypeline (and maybe for steps) 
    - (in dev mode, executes all steps but doesnot actually release exports detailed review of global context) 
    - (in test mode: executes the entire pypeline, but only on random sampled values, exports detailed review of global context and detailed review of execution, but only for random sampled values) 
    - (in prod mode, executes entire pypeline on whole dataset, generates detailed review of execution on all data)
- implement 'on_error' functionality (ignore, log, raise)

post v4 TODO:
- pylint
- documentation
- pytests
- upload to pip

future
- add universal engine
- add MT and MP
- add REST compatible e/l
- use other container types (numpy, spark dataframes)
- optimized data viz
- conditional steps (ie skip step, perform step)
- intermediate chunking checkpoints
- looped steps
